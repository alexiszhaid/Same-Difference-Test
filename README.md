# Same/Different Test in Sensory Evaluation with R

This project demonstrates the application of the **Same/Different** discrimination test using simulated data, following standard sensory evaluation methodologies.

## 📋 Overview

The Same/Different test is commonly used in sensory science to determine whether panelists can detect perceptual differences between two products. This document covers:

- ✅ Brief theoretical overview of the method  
- 📊 Construction of a confusion matrix  
- 🔢 Chi-square and McNemar tests for independence and symmetry  
- 🧠 Signal detection modeling using the `sensR` package  
- 📈 Estimation of *d′* and response bias (*tau*)  
- 📚 Citations and references handled through a `.bib` file

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- R (base and tidyverse)
- `sensR` package for signal detection theory modeling
- `DT` for interactive tables
- `bookdown` or `rmarkdown` for dynamic reporting

## 📁 Files

- `same-different.Rmd` – Main R Markdown document with analysis and interpretation
- `references.bib` – Bibliographic references in BibTeX format
- `apa.csl` – APA style citation file (optional)
- `README.md` – This file
